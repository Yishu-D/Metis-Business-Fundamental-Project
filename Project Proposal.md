# Project Proposal
## NFL Combined Data Case Study: Physical Attributes & Players Drafting

### Clients:

NFL manager and coaches. 

### Question:

Is there a correlation between body shapes and player performance? Is there a pattern on best body shapes for each position? Can this result be used for coaches to identify potential talents?

### Impact:

The project is expected to find the optimum body shapes for each position, so the coaches can have a reference when they draft players. 

### Data description:

For this project, I will be using an NFL dataset that includes play-by-play data from the 2004 to 2019 seasons and all players personal information. A unit of analysis will be an individual player’ body shape information and his play performance. The features include position, heights, weight, hand size, arm length, interceptions, kicks, passing yards, rushing yards, sacks, tackles. (More features will be added if necessary)

### Solution Path:

I want to identify the optimum body shapes for different positions in football. I hypothesize that finding the correlation between body features and performance will achieve that. The NFL coaches can predict a free agent’s potential by looking at his physical features. 

### Criteria for Success:

If the hypothesis stands, then there will be a significant correlation between body features and play stats. 

### Assumptions and Risks:

More research is needed for assumptions but there is a risk that there is no prototype of body shapes or criteria for players. Also, players’ performance can be improved by trainings, or some players might not have the perfect body features but are extremely talented. 

### Tools:

Excel and Tableau

### MVP goal:
A clean excel dataset that is ready to be visualized.
