# Project Write-Up
## NFL Combined Data Case Study: Physical Attributes & Players Drafting


### Abstract

This project inspected an NFL combined dataset and explored the different patterns of football players, expecting to give NFL team managers and coaches a reason to engage data analytics during the drafting process. I worked with data provided by [Todd Steussie](https://www.kaggle.com/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present?select=combine.csv), aggregated the dataset using Excel and Python, built an interactive dashboard to visualize and communicate my result using Tableau.




### Design

This project was inspired by one of my courses in graduate school, gridiron analytics, which opened the door to sports analytics. [Todd Steussie](https://www.kaggle.com/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present?select=combine.csv) provides the dataset used for this project. By building an interactive visualization of the data, this project showed generic physical attributes/body types of different positions of football players. Moreover, the results will help the coaches discover football talents in a cost-efficient and scientific way.


<details><summary>Impact hypothesis</summary>
<p>

This project expects to give NFL team managers and coaches a reason to engage data analytics during the drafting process. The project hypothesizes that, first, different position players have specific physical figures. For example, the most crucial player, the Quarterback, either hands the ball to the running back or passes the ball to a receiver, occasionally runs with the ball. So the Quarterbacks always have a medium height and weight. They need to be tall enough to pass the ball over the defenders, but they cannot be so big that they cannot dodge the tackles. For the defensive side, linebackers are pretty tall, but they are not the heaviest because they need to be solid and fast to shadow RBs, TEs, and sometimes WRs; rush the passer and tackle ball carriers.

The second hypothesis is that players' best-suited positions are not necessarily the position they started with; they can be determined according to the draft tests scores.

<details><summary>Solution paths</summary>
<p>

**Suggested solution path:**
Determine if football players have different body types/physical attributes based on:
- Height and weight,
- Drafting tests scores,
- Performance data like passing yards, comp%, receiving yards, tackles. 

</p>
</details>



<details><summary>Measures of success</summary>
<p>

- Technical: successfully build the interactive visualization that shows clear pattern of different body types and physical strengths. 
- Non-technical: the result matches the reality

### Data

The original dataset includes play-by-play data from the 2004 to 2019 seasons and players' physical data like heights, weight, shuttle time, bench press repetitions, etc. After aggregation, the dataset contains 10,081 players' data with 22 features for each. A few feature highlights include weight, heights, passing yards, yards after catch, tackles, bench press repetitions, etc.

### Algorithms

This project does not include building models; thus, no algorithm was used.

### Tools

- Excel for simple data aggregation
- Python for advanced data aggregation and cleaning
- Tableau for interactive visualizations

### Communication

In addition to the slides and visuals presented, NFL Combined Data Case Study will be embedded on my website and blog.
